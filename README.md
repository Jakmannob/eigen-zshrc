# eigen-zshrc

My personal .zshrc-file with some useful aliases.

## Commands needed

The following applications need to be installed for all aliases to work:

- `bat` (`cat` with syntax highlighting and `git` integration)
- `code` (VSCode or Code - OSS as text editor. Useful for Jupyter notebooks)
- `cowsay` (generates ASCII pictures of creatures that tell text input)
- `fortune` (generates a MOTD)
- `git`
- `gitlab-runner` (only needed if you have to run gitlab CI/CD jobs)
- `lolcat` (`cat` with cool rainbow effect)
- `objdump`
- `pandoc` (Markdown converter)
- `ps2pdf` (PostScript to PDF)
- `pdf2ps` (PDF to PostScript)
- `screenfetch` (super cool system information for forgetful users)
- `tree` (like `ls`, but generates a tree structure of nested directories)
- `vim` (most important text editor)
- `virtualbox` (only if you want to run VMs)
